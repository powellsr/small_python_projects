'''BATTLESHIP!
Make a List
Good! Now well use a built-in Python function to generate our board, which well make into a 5 x 5 grid of all "O"s, for ocean.

print ["O"] * 5
will print out ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'], which is the basis for a row of our board.

Well do this five times to make five rows. (Since we have to do this five times, it sounds like a loop might be in order.)

Instructions
1.
Create a 5 x 5 grid initialized to all Os and store it in board.

Use range() to loop 5 times.
Inside the loop, .append() a list containing 5 "O"s to board, just like in the example above.
Note that these are capital letter O and not zeros.'''
board = []
for index in range(5): # Recall, starts at 0, goes to index-1
  board.append(["O"] * 5) # syntax inside .append() produces a lst of 5 "O"s
