'''BATTLESHIP!
Play It, Sam
You can successfully make one guess in Battleship! But wed like our game to allow the player to make up to 4 guesses before they lose.

for turn in range(4):
  # Make a guess
  # Test that guess
We can use a for loop to iterate through a range. Each iteration will be a turn.

Instructions
1.
Add a for loop that repeats the guessing and checking part of your game for 4 turns, like the example above.

At the beginning of each iteration, print "Turn", turn + 1 to let the player know what turn they are on.

Indent everything that should be repeated.'''
