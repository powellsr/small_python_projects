Custom Print
Now we can see the contents of our list, but clearly it would be easier to play the game if we could print the board out like a grid with each row on its own line.

We can use the fact that our board is a list of lists to help us do this. Lets set up a for loop to go through each of the elements in the outer list (each of which is a row of our board) and print them.

Instructions
1.
First, delete your existing print statement.

Then, define a function named print_board with a single argument, board_in.

Inside the function, write a for loop to iterates through each row in board and print it to the screen.

Call your function with board to make sure it works.'''
board = []
for index in range(5): # Recall, starts at 0, goes to index-1
  board.append(["O"] * 5) # syntax inside .append() produces a lst of 5 "O"s
def print_board(board_in):
  for row in board:
    print row
print_board(board)
