'''BATTLESHIP!
Printing Pretty
Were getting pretty close to a playable board, but wouldnt it be nice to get rid of those quote marks and commas? Were storing our data as a list, but the player doesnt need to know that!

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
print " ".join(letters)
print "---".join(letters)
In the example above, we create a list called letters.
Then, we print a b c d. The .join method uses the string to combine the items in the list.
Finally, we print a---b---c---d. We are calling the .join function on the "---" string.
We want to turn each row into "O O O O O".

Instructions
1.
Inside your function, inside your for loop, use " " as the separator to .join the elements of each row.'''
board = []
for index in range(5): # Recall, starts at 0, goes to index-1
  board.append(["O"] * 5) # syntax inside .append() produces a lst of 5 "O"s
def print_board(board_in):
  for row in board:
    print " ".join(row)
print_board(board)
