'''BATTLESHIP!
Hide...
Excellent! Now, lets hide our battleship in a random location on the board.

Since we have a 2-dimensional list, well use two variables to store the ships location, ship_row and ship_col.

from random import randint
coin = randint(0, 1)
dice = randint(1, 6)
In the above example, we first import the randint(low, high) function from the random module.
Then, we generate either zero or one and store it in coin.
Finally, we generate a number from one to six inclusive.
Lets generate a random_row and random_col from zero to four!

Instructions
1.
Define two new functions, random_row and random_col, that each take board_in as input.

These functions should return a random row index and a random column index from your board, respectively. Use randint(0, len(board_in) - 1).

Call each function on board.'''
from random import randint #Importing randint module

board = []

for x in range(0, 5):
  board.append(["O"] * 5)

def print_board(board):
  for row in board:
    print " ".join(row)

# Add your code below!
def random_row(board_in):#This fn will define a random number within range of no. rows in board
  return randint(0, len(board_in) - 1)

def random_col(board_in):#This fn will define a random number within range of no. columns, is this fortuitous because we have a square? Could we work with a rectangle?
  return randint(0, len(board_in) - 1)
