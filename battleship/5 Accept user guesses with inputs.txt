'''BATTLESHIP!
...and Seek!
Good job! For now, lets store coordinates for the ship in the variables ship_row and ship_col. Now you have a hidden battleship in your ocean! Lets write the code to allow the player to guess where it is.

number = raw_input("Enter a number: ")
if int(number) == 0:
  print "You entered 0"
raw_input asks the user for input and returns it as a string. But were going to want to use integers for our guesses! To do this, well wrap the raw_inputs with int() to convert the string to an integer.

Instructions
1.
Create a new variable called guess_row and set it to int(raw_input("Guess Row: ")).

Create a new variable called guess_col and set it to int(raw_input("Guess Col: ")).

Click Run and then answer the prompts by typing in a number and pressing Enter (or Return on some computers).'''

ship_row = random_row(board)
ship_col = random_col(board)

# Add your code below!
guess_row = int(raw_input("Guess Row: "))#Gets guess from user for row (next = column) recall python uses prompt / input combined). int() converts string to integer.

guess_col = int(raw_input("Guess Col: "))
