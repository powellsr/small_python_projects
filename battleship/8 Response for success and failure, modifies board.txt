'''BATTLESHIP!
Danger, Will Robinson!!
Great! Of course, the player isnt going to guess right all the time, so we also need to handle the case where the guess is wrong.

print board[2][3]
The example above prints out "O", the element in the 3rd row and 4th column.

Instructions
1.
Add an else under the if we wrote in the previous step.

Print out "You missed my battleship!"

Set the list element at guess_row, guess_col to "X".

As the last line in your else statement, call print_board(board) again so you can see the "X".Make sure to enter a col and row that is on the board!'''

from random import randint

board = []

for x in range(0, 5):
  board.append(["O"] * 5)

    print " ".join(row)

  return randint(0, len(board) - 1)

  return randint(0, len(board[0]) - 1)

guess_col = int(raw_input("Guess Col: "))

# Write your code below!
if guess_row == ship_row and guess_col == ship_col:
  print "Congratulations! You sank my battleship!"
else:
  print "You missed my battleship!"
  board[guess_row][guess_col] = "X" #note: this notation calls the first bracket from the board, the second bracket value from the list defined by the first bracket, I think
  print_board(board)
